## Howdy!
I'm Owen and currently studying computer science at Clarkson University. 

Some areas of interest that I would like to explore are machine learning and computer vision.
I will upload personal projects and some of the course projects I find interesting to my page.

Outside of school I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, ham radio, and gaming.
